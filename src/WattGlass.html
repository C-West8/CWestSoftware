            <p>
                During my Senior Year of college, I had a part time internship
                with WattGlass. <br />
                They were a small startup at the time, with only 8 employees.
                <br />
                My projects were focused on their assemly line, and testing
                their products, while keeping costs as low as possible.

                Multiple samples must be measured at the same time, in the same
